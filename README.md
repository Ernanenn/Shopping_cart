## Features

Calculating the total amount: The total purchase amount is automatically calculated and displayed on the screen.

Clearing the cart: The user can clear the cart at any time.

## Technologies Used
HTML: Page structure.
CSS: Page styling.
JavaScript: Application logic, DOM manipulation and calculations.

Scalability: To create a more complete shopping cart, it would be necessary to add features such as user authentication, inventory management, and integration with a payment system.
Visual improvements: The user interface can be improved by using CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap or Materialize.
